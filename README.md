## Getting Started
### Installation
Use Nuget to download the package
```
dotnet add package Xero.NetStandard.OAuth2.Client
dotnet add package Xero.NetStandard.OAuth2.AccountApi

```
or using the Package Manager Console inside Visual Studio

```
Install-Package Xero.NetStandard.OAuth2.Client
Install-Package Xero.NetStandard.OAuth2.AccountApi

```
or you can download the source code from https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-NetStandard and compile it by yourself.


### Create a Xero App
Follow these steps to create your Xero app

* Create a free Xero user account (if you don't have one)
* Use this URL for beta access to oAuth2 [https://developer.xero.com/myapps?code=oauth2create](https://developer.xero.com/myapps?code=oauth2create)
* Click "or Try oAuth2" link
* Enter your App name, company url, privacy policy url, and redirect URI (this is your callback url - localhost, etc)
* Agree to terms and condition and click "Create App".
* Click "Generate a secret" button.
* Copy your client id and client secret and save for use later.
* Click the "Save" button. You secret is now hidden.

To get started there are a few main classes.

* The AccountingApi class
* XeroOAuth2

The AccountingApi class is not coupled to the OAuth2 class, so feel free to use your own.


To get started you will just need two things to make calls to the Accounting Api.
* xero-tenant-id
* accessToken


Build the login link
```csharp

XeroConfiguration xconfig = new XeroConfiguration(); //this will probably be changed to a proper constructor
    xconfig.ClientId = "yourClientId";
    xconfig.ClientSecret = "yourClientSecret";
    xconfig.CallbackUri = new Uri("https://localhost:5001") //default for standard webapi template
    xconfig.Scope = "openid profile email files accounting.transactions accounting.contacts offline_access";
//instatiate your client(maybe need to change this name to XeroOAuth2Client so its not confusing
    var client = new XeroClient(xconfig);
    //build login link
    Console.WriteLine(client.BuildLoginUri());
//In the example app, I've used the config via appsettings so it becomes:
            var client = new Xero.NetStandard.OAuth2.Client.XeroClient(config.Value, httpClientFactory);

    
```

From here the user will be redirected to login, authorise access and get redirected back

On the way back you will get a parameter with code and state
* code
* state

```csharp

XeroConfiguration xconfig = new XeroConfiguration(); //this will probably be changed to a proper constructor
    xconfig.ClientId = "yourClientId";
    xconfig.ClientSecret = "yourClientSecret";
    xconfig.CallbackUri = new Uri("https://localhost:5001") //default for standard webapi template
    xconfig.Scope = "openid profile email files accounting.transactions accounting.contacts offline_access";
    var client = new XeroClient(xconfig);
    //before getting the access token please check that the state matches
    await client.RequestAccessTokenAsync(code, "yourState");
    //from here you will need to access your Xero Tenants
    List<Tenant> tenants = await client.GetConnections();
    // you will now have the tenant id and access token
    foreach (Tenant tenant in tenants)
    {
        // do something with your tenant and access token
        //client.AccessToken;
        //tenant.TenantId;
    }

```
To refresh your token. Just call the refresh 
```csharp


```


```csharp

//Here is a full example using a webapi
       [HttpGet]
        public async Task<ActionResult> Index(string code, string state)
        {
            var client = new XeroClient(config.Value, httpClientFactory);
            var xeroToken = (XeroOAuth2Token)await client.RequestXeroTokenAsync(code);
            TokenUtilities.StoreToken(Environment.MachineName, xeroToken);
            return RedirectToAction("Invoices", "Accounting");
        }

```


To setup the main API object see the snippet below

```csharp
//
var AccountingApi = new AccountingApi();
var response = await AccountingApi.GetInvoicesAsync(accessToken, xeroTenantId);
Console.WriteLine(AccountingApi.GetInvoices().ToJson();)

```
